%% 2e - Discussion
% As seen by the figure in section 2b, varying the mesh density caused the
% current density to decrease in what appeared to be an asymptotic fashion.
% This may mean that the simulation over estimates the current density for
% low mesh densities. It would have been beneficial to simulated a few
% larger mesh densities, but the time required to simulated even the largest mesh
% densities done here was quite large. 
% 
% As shown in the figure in section 2c, the current density increased
% exponentially. Since the width of the box was 120, as Wb approaches 60
% the two insulating rectangles come close to making contact and shortening
% the channel that the current has to traverse. Wb =59 and Wb=60 were
% excluded from the plot as it obscured the data for the lower values, but
% they continued along the same exponential trend.
% 
% In the figure for section 2d both the x and y axes are plotted
% logarithmically to preserve the information present in the slides. For
% these simulations the conductivity of the rectangles were kept at 1e-2.
% As shown, for low conductivities the current density saturates, but as
% the conductivity increases the current density drops drastically. This
% makes some sense, as when the box has a conductivity of 1e-4 and the
% rectangles have a conductivity of 1e-2, the rectangles are more
% conducting than the rest of the box, but when the conductivity of the box
% increases to 1e2 it becomes more conducting than the rectangles.
